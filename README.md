NSObject+ObjectIO
=============

This is a drop-in category of NSObject that allows saving and loading of your objects. This uses the [NSObject+ObjectMap](https://github.com/uacaps/NSObject-ObjectMap) base category and extends it further. AES256 encryption/decryption is included in this class as well for optionally securing your files when you save or load them.

--------------------

## Set Up ##
